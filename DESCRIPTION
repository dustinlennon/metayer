Description: Metayer is a collection of package development tools. It provides graphic device wrappers that
  allow uniform figure generation across publishing contexts including Jupyter, knitr, and from the
  shell. Metayer also integrates the cli and logger packages so that calls to cli methods show up
  in the logs imbued with package-level context. There is a global, hierarchical storage container
  that leverages native R environments. Metayer also provides a with-style wrapper that wrapper
  that facilitates temporary and safe monkey patching of namespaced internals. There are also a few
  helper methods for inspecting function stack environments associated with dynamic scoping.
