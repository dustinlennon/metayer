metayer
====

Metayer is a collection of package development tools.  The package provides:

+ graphic device wrappers that allow uniform figure generation across publishing contexts including Jupyter,
  knitr, and from the shell;
+ an integration of the [cli](https://cli.r-lib.org/index.html) and [logger](https://daroczig.github.io/logger/index.html)
  packages so that calls to cli methods show up in the logs, imbued with package-level context;
+ a global, hierarchical storage container that leverages native R environments;
+ a with-style wrapper that wrapper that facilitates temporary and safer monkey patching of namespaced internals;
+ helper methods for inspecting function stack environments associated with dynamic scoping; and,
+ some useful but not particularly exciting utility methods.
